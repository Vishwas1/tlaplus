> The hard part of learning to write TLA+ specs is learning to **think abstractly** about the system. Being able to think abstractly improves our design process.

## Describing state machine with math

Recall, We introduced `pc` to descibe the control state.


```c
int i;
void main(){
    i = someNumber();  
    i = i + 1; 
}
```

1. Possible intial values of variables
2. Relation between thier values in current state and their possible values in the next state


### Initial values

```
i  = 0  and pc = start
```
can be represented as:

relace the `and` with mathematical representaiton of `&&`, i.e `^`

```
(i = 0) ^ (pc = start)

```

### Relation between thier values in current state and their possible values in the next state

```
if current value of pc == start
    then next value of i in {0,1, .... 1000} 
         next vlaue of pc = middle
else if pc == middle
    then next value = i + 1 
         next value of pc = done
else no next value
```


Let's convert this in maths:

lets use `pc` or `i` for current values and `pc'` or `i'` for next values. And replace the word `equal` with `=`

```
if pc = start
    then i' in {0,1, .... 1000}  
         pc' = middle
else if pc = middle
    then i' = i + 1  
         pc' = done
else no next values
```

This is lot easier to read but not yet mathematical.

```
IF pc = "start"
    THEN (i' \in 0...1000) /\
         (pc' = "middle")
    ELSE IF pc = "middle"
        THEN (i' = i + 1) /\
             (pc' = "done")
        ELSE FALSE
```
We are not writing instruction but formula. So the above statement means, if `pc = "start"`, the formula equals `then` formula, otherwise it equals the `else` formula. Let's say,

```
|----------------------|       _____
|(i' \in 0...1000) /\  |====> |     |
|(pc' = "middle")      |      |  A  |
|                      |      |_____|
|----------------------|
```

And 

```
|----------------------|       _____
|(i' = i + 1) /\       |====> |     |
|(pc' = "done")        |      |  B  |
|                      |      |_____|
|----------------------|
```

Then we can write,

```
IF pc = "start"
    THEN A
    ELSE IF pc = "middle"
        THEN B
        ELSE FALSE
```

We can write complete Mathematical description as two formulas:

```
Initial-state formula: (i = 0) /\ (pc = "start")
```

```
Next state formula: IF pc = "start"
                        THEN A
                        ELSE IF pc = "middle"
                            THEN B
                            ELSE FALSE
```

There are two cases when the formula is true:

1. (pc = "start") and A is true. i.e. `(pc = "start") /\ A` is true
2. (pc = "middle") and B is true. i.e. `(pc = "middle") /\ B` is true

We can re-write the next state formula like this:

```
Next state formula: (pc = "start") /\ A
                    OR (pc = "middle") /\ B          
```


```
Next state formula: (pc = "start") /\ A
                    \/ (pc = "middle") /\ B          
```

Now lets replace A and B

```
(
        (   (pc = "start")   
        /\ (i' \in 0...1000) 
        /\ (pc' = "middle") )
    \/  (   (pc = "middle")  
        /\ (i' = i + 1)      
        /\ (pc' = "done")   )
)
```


Now lets remove some of these parenthesis as they are not very helpful:

```
(
        (   pc = "start"
        /\  i' \in 0...1000
        /\  pc' = "middle" )
    \/  (   pc = "middle"  
        /\  i' = i + 1      
        /\  pc' = "done"   )
)
```

Furthermore, the inner parenthesis can be replaced with another and (`/\`) symbol.


```
(
        /\  pc = "start"
        /\  i' \in 0...1000
        /\  pc' = "middle" 
    \/  /\  pc = "middle"  
        /\  i' = i + 1      
        /\  pc' = "done"   
)
```

The outer most parenthesis can also be replace with another OR (`/\`) symbol.

```
    \/ /\  pc = "start"
       /\  i' \in 0...1000
       /\  pc' = "middle" 
    \/ /\  pc = "middle"  
       /\  i' = i + 1      
       /\  pc' = "done"   
```

Now we can compare out TLA| formula with our C code. 


```
    \/ /\  pc = "start"                     int i;
       /\  i' \in 0...1000                  void main(){
       /\  pc' = "middle"                       i = someNumber();
    \/ /\  pc = "middle"                        i = i + 1;
       /\  i' = i + 1                       }
       /\  pc' = "done"      
```

The C code probably seems to to be simple becuase its more familiar. But it not   

Programning language dont let you abstract above the code level. 

It is imporant to remmber this a formula and not the sequence of command. 


## The complete TLA+ speciafication

Module: SimpleProgram
```
EXTENDS Integers
VARIABLES i, pc

Init == (pc = "start") /\ (i = 0)

Next == \/ /\  pc = "start"
           /\  i' \in 0...1000
           /\  pc' = "middle" 
        \/ /\  pc = "middle"  
           /\  i' = i + 1      
           /\  pc' = "done"
```

for real spec the next state can be 100s of line. We can understand a big formula by splitting it into smaller parts. Math has a very simple and powerful way to do that: Using definitions. Take a look below


```
Pick == /\  pc = "start"
        /\  i' \in 0...1000
        /\  pc' = "middle" 

Add1 == /\  pc = "middle"  
        /\  i' = i + 1      
        /\  pc' = "done"

Next == Pick \/ Add1
```
